2. When you connect to the remote computer via the terminal, it will prompt you with the message "Are you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?". Simply type "yes" and press enter.
3. You will then be prompted to enter your password. Try using the password associated with your tritonlink account first. If the password is incorrect, you will need to reset it on the course-specific website mentioned earlier. Please note that it may take a few minutes for the password reset to take effect.

3. Then, within the repository, create a new file by clicking the "add files" button. Give the file a name, such as "index.MD", and write something into the file.
4. Click “Commit new file” to save the work. You should see a view of your repository that now lists a file called index.md, and you can then copy the link from your browser and share it with your friends.

5. In the settings, ensure that the branch is set to "main" and that all other settings are left as they are. Remember to save these changes.
You should then receive a message that the source has been added. After a short wait, a link will become available, which you can use to visit your website.
